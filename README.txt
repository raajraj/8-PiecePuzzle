WELCOME TO RAAJITHA'S 8-PIECE-PUZZLE

HOW TO GET STARTED

1. It is fairly easy because there is only one file with code... main.cpp. Please go to the directory with that file after unzipping. 

2. It is required to use a certain software that has updated C++ versions or any C++ version that will support modern code.

3. You can attempt to run with main.cpp in your directory... â€¨
	$ g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror main.cpp -o main
	$ ./main

4. That is not recommended as sometimes the terminal does not support it. Although, my terminal does support the prior command. I recommend using Xcode or Visual Studio to run the code. 

5. From there you will be prompted to select options for user input or a default puzzle. You will also be asked to pick an algorithm.

6. DO NOT type in extra spaces, random characters, or numbers that do not correspond to what is asked for. It will terminate or not go further with the program. I only coded for input that is correct and not for typos. You can always just restart the program if a mistake is made. 

7. You will be able to see a trace after inserting your choices. The trace will lead you to the solution which is an 8-piece-puzzle that looks like this...
